<!-- ==== OCPS Carpooling Publication ==== -->
<!-- 
OCPS (Open Carpooling Standard) is a flexible framework designed specifically for carpooling services. It allows for dynamic ride-sharing arrangements, where passengers and drivers can match based on factors like time, location, vehicle availability, and other user-specific preferences. Key features of OCPS include:
- Flexible ride statuses (pending, accepted, started, ended)
- Passenger registration via QR code or app for verification and booking
- Payment models based on distance, with possibilities for future rush-hour pricing and promotions
- Options for passengers and drivers to specify vehicle requirements (e.g., child seats, accessibility features)

NeTEx (Network and Timetable Exchange) is an international standard for describing public transport networks and services, including schedules, routes, and vehicle data. It is designed to support the exchange of timetable and network information between different transport providers and systems. Key features of NeTEx include:
- Static timetables and network descriptions for scheduled services
- Public transport vehicle and route data (e.g., buses, trams, trains)
- Service point and stop information

The difference between OCPS and NeTEx is that while NeTEx focuses on the structured data for fixed, scheduled public transport services, OCPS focuses on the flexibility of ride-sharing and carpooling, where users can dynamically interact with the system and modify their travel plans based on real-time needs and preferences.
